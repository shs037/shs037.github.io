## About me

I got my PhD from [UC San Diego](http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/) in Machine Learning and Differential Privacy under the supervision of [Prof. Kamalika Chaudhuri](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/). Before joining UCSD, I obtained my BSc degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk).

I work at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/).
